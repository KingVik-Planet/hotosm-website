This past year, Covid-19 exposed the world’s devastating inequalities, disproportionately affecting the communities we serve in low- and middle-income countries. Supported by the H2H Network, HOT coordinated its most extensive crisis mapping activation in history to identify where at-risk populations live and where data on health infrastructure is missing. We also set up HOT’s first-ever Rapid Response Microgrants, quickly mobilizing funds to seven OSM communities looking to support the pandemic response in their countries. Beyond Covid-19 response, we opened regional hubs in the Asia Pacific and Eastern and Southern Africa and supported 27 communities with grants that contributed to the training of over 1,700 people in creating and using OSM data.
