2020 was dominated by the Covid-19 global pandemic. It quickly became clear that the one billion people living in completely or partially unmapped communities risked being left out of life-saving programs. Response to the pandemic represents HOT's largest response ever in terms of contributions.  In the same year, HOT celebrated its 10 year anniversary and was selected by The Audacious Project,  a collaborative philanthropic initiative that serves as a springboard for social impact on a grand scale allowing the organization to scale up support to local OpenStreetMap (OSM) mapping communities with the audacious goal of mobilizing one million volunteers to map an area home to one billion people in 94 countries at high risk of disasters or experiencing multidimensional poverty.
